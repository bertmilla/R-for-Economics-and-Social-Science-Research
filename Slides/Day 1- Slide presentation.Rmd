* is open source and freely available

* is a cross-platform language

* has an extensive and coherent set of tools for statistical analysis

* has an extensive and highly flexible graphical facility for producing publication-ready graphics

* has an expanding set of freely available ‘packages’ to extend R’s capabilities

* has an extensive support network with numerous online and freely available documents

#  Overview of R and RStudio

* RStudio is an add-on user-friendly interface to R 

* It incorporates the R Console, a script editor and other useful functionality

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pic1.png")
```

# Installing and loading packages

* R packages are collections of functions, data sets, and documentation that enhance R's functionality (e. g. <tt>tidyverse</tt>, <tt>ggplot2</tt>, <tt>readxl</tt>)

* They help users to efficiently perform specific tasks more easily

* Many R packages can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archiving Network (CRAN): *>22,000 packages*

* Type in the Console <tt>install.packages("*packagename*")</tt>

* Alternative: Click **Tools** in the Menu bar and select *Install Packages...*

# Data types and basic operations

* R **objects** are fundamental data containers: <tt>vectors</tt>, <tt>matrices</tt>, <tt>data frames</tt>, <tt>lists</tt>, and <tt>functions</tt>

* Objects are created using the assignment operator: <tt>*<-*</tt>

```{r }
a <- 10
b <- 5
c <- sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
print(c)
```

* A few rules in naming objects in R:

   - R is case-sensitive: <tt>Weight</tt> is different from <tt>weight</tt>
   
   - Object names should be explicit and not too long
   
   - Do not start a name with a number such as <tt>2cm</tt>
   

---

# Data types and basic operations: vector

* one-dimensional arrays that hold elements of the same type, such as numbers, characters, or logical values

```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)          # Numeric vector
character_vector <- c("apple", "banana") # Character vector
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)   # Logical vector
```

```{r}
numeric_vector
character_vector
logical_vector
```

---

# Data types and basic operations: vector



```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3) 
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
x + y # Adds the elements of x and y
y^x # y is raised to power x
x * y # To get the product of the elements of x and y
```

---
# Data types and basic operations: vector

* Elements of a vector can be accessed as follows: 

```{r}
set.seed(1234) # Allows to generate the same set of random numbers
z <- rnorm(n = 6, mean = 0, sd = 1)
z # Prints all elements of z
z[4] # Extracts the 4th element of z
z[4:6] # Extracts the 4th through the 7th elements of z
z[c(1,3,5)] # Extracts the 1st, ,3rd, and 5th elements of z
```
---
# Data types and basic operations: vector

* Basic functions in working with vectors: <tt>length()</tt>, <tt>sum()</tt>, <tt>mean()</tt>, <tt>sd()</tt>

```{r}
length(z) # Determines the number of elements of z
sum(z) # Determines the sum of the elements of z
mean(z) # Calculates the mean/average of the elements of z
sd(z) # Calculates the standard deviation of the elements of z
```

---
# Data types and basic operations: matrix

* two-dimensional arrangement of data (of same type) in rows and columns

* are collections of vectors organized into rows and columns
```{r}
A <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) # Create a 3x3 numeric matrix
print(A)

B <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE) # Create a 3x3 numeric matrix
print(B)
```

---
# Data types and basic operations: matrix

* Addition, subtraction and multiplication of matrices are shown below:


```{r}
A + B # Addition

A - B # Subutraction

A %*% B # Multiplication
```

---
# Data types and basic operations: list

* Used to store mixtures of data types
```{r}
mylist <- list(char_vector = c("black", "yellow", "orange"),
               logic_vector = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
               num_mat= matrix(1:6, nrow = 3))
print(mylist)
```

---
# Data types and basic operations: list

* We can apply indexing to extract one or more elements of a list just like in a vector

```{r}
print(mylist[2]) # Prints the logical vector

print(mylist[3]) # Prints the numeric matrix
```

---
# Data types and basic operations: data frame

.pull-left[
* a two-dimensional, tabular data structure where each column can contain elements of different data types (numeric, character, logical, etc.)

* every row corresponds to an observation or case (e. g. student, firm, university); a column corresponds to a variable (e. g. age, sex, marital status)

* most commonly used data structure for statistical analysis and data manipulation

# R Markdown

- a simple and easy to use plain text language where one can type R codes and see the results (e.g. plots and tables) after running these codes in the one document

- useful to generate a single nicely formatted and reproducible document (like a report, publication, thesis chapter or a web page, slides)

- the document can be rendered in HTML, pdf, or Word format

# Quick review of hypothesis testing

- **Testing hypotheses**: a procedure used to decide which of two competing hypotheses are consistent with data observed in a random sample

   - **Null hypothesis** ($H_0$): hypothesis indicating no "effect" (no change, no improvement, no correlation)
   
   - **Alternative hypothesis** ($H_1$): researcher's hypothesis that indicates an "effect" 
   
   - **Test statistic**: a summary of the observed data in the random sample that is used as evidence *for* or *against* the null hypothesis
   
   - **Level of significance**: the probability of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis ($\alpha = 0.01, \mathbf{0.05}$)
   
   - **p-value**: the chance that the observed results (or more extreme results) would occur **IF** the null hypothesis were true
   
      - Smaller p-values indicate *disagreement* between the observed data and the null hypothesis: **Reject $H_0$ if p-value $\leq \alpha$**

# Correlation analysis: basic ideas

- Correlation analysis is concerned with the analysis of linear relationship between two or more variables

- It is used to determine the strength and direction, as well as statistical significance, of the correlation between variables

- The correlation between two variables could be positive or negative

- Positive correlation: $X\uparrow$ and $Y\uparrow$ or $X\downarrow$ and $Y\downarrow$

- Negative correlation: $X\uparrow$ and $Y\downarrow$ or $X\downarrow$ and $Y\uparrow$

# Correlation analysis: scatter plot
.pull-left[
- It is a chart of the x-values (X-axis) and y-values (Y-axis) 

- It is a visual representation of the relationship of X and Y

- Also known as *scatter diagram*

# Correlation analysis: correlation coefficient

- measures the strength or magnitude of the correlation between the variables

   - **Pearson r**: both variables are measured in at least interval scale; bivariate normal distribution
   
   - **Spearman rho**: both variables are measured in at ordinal scale; non-normal data
   
   - **Point-biserial**: one variable is binary and the other is interval or ratio
   
   - **Rank-biserial**: one variable is binary and the other is ordinal

   
- the value of a correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1

# Correlation analysis: correlation coefficient

# Correlation analysis: test of significance


- $H_0$: Correlation coefficient is equal to zero. (There is no linear relationship between the variables.) $\Longrightarrow H_0: \rho = 0$
   
- $H_1$: Correlation coefficient is not equal to zero. (There is linear relationship between the variables.) $\Longrightarrow H_1: \rho \neq 0$

- Test statistic:

$$
t = \frac{r \sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}
$$

- Reject $H_0$ if p-value associated with $t$ is less than the significance level ($\alpha$)
